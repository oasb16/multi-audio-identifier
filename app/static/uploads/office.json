    "environment_inference": "This audio is quite fast-paced, similar to the rhythm you could find in many dance or electronic music tracks. It's not very loud, rather gentle and unobtrusive, but it carries a significant amount of high-frequency content. That suggests it might have many bright, sharp elements, perhaps like the crisp sound of a violin or a flute playing a rapid tune. \n\nThe audio would also have a wide variety of frequencies, reflecting diverse musical tones or different instruments, similar to what you may find in a full band or an orchestra. The highest pitch is fairly high, suggesting that there may be high singing, like a soprano, or sharp instruments like a piccolo or a whistle.\n\nIn a nutshell, imagine you're in a bustling, lively festival where a varied band is performing a frenzied, bright tune, but the overall sound is not deafening, instead it\u2019s more soothing and balanced, whilst the occasional high pitched instrument adds intensity to the experience."
