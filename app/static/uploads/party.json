    "environment_inference": "The audio is moderately paced with a tempo matching a relaxed heartbeat. It's not very loud, offering a quiet, subtle experience. The spectral centroid indicates a sound quality that leans more towards the lower end of the spectrum, suggesting a warm, fuller texture rather than sharp or bright. The spectral bandwidth suggests some degree of varied frequencies in the mix, indicating a rich sound texture with both high and low pitches. The high maximum pitch means there are sharp, high-pitched sounds occasionally, like a sudden, brief ring of a bell or string instrument. This could be perceived as a soothing, comforting piece with underlying complexity and occasional striking elements."
