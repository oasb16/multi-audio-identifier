    "environment_inference": "If you imagine sitting in a room, the audio playing around you is in a moderate pace \u2013 not too fast, not too slow. It has a comfortable rhythm akin to a walk in a park, subtly energizing and not in a rush. The quality of the sound is quite balanced, occupying a middle ground - it's neither skewed too high nor too low. This means the sounds are not treble-heavy (like flutes or birds chirping) but also not full of deep bass notes (like a drum or bass guitar). \n\nThe overall sound texture hits the middling tones, like a conversation in a coffee shop or the mix of notes you hear in pop or rock music. Though, the maximum pitch is quite high, reaching the likes of a high note on a piano or perhaps a violin's pitch, offering a possible sudden treble spikes in an overall balanced audio landscape. The general 'feel' will be that of a composed but energetic track, potentially with moments of high-pitched intensity."
